## What is this?
The UK government makes these datasets available as part of a data transparency effort. The collection can be found at (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-wine-cellar)[https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-wine-cellar]. Per the website, "The wine cellar supports the work of Government Hospitality in providing business hospitality for all government ministers and departments."

Contained in this folder are five (5) distinct datasets, all of which are yearly inventories of the wine cellar stock.
